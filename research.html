        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>My core expertise is in civil wars, rebel governance, and post-conflict political orders, with long-standing work on Kurdistan and Sri Lanka. I study how armed groups build and transform political authority, including power-sharing arrangements and the institutions of de facto authorities such as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (DAANES).</p>

        <p>I am a Research Fellow with the ITALIM project (“Italy and the International Politics of Food Security”) at the University of Naples “L’Orientale”. My current research examines the politics of food security in conflict-affected settings, linking academic research with practitioner needs.</p>
