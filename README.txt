# Andrea Novellis – Static Academic Website

This folder contains a simple static website (pure HTML + CSS). It can be hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

## How to put it online with GitHub Pages

1. Create a free GitHub account (if you do not have one yet) at github.com.
2. Create a new public repository called `andrea-novellis-site` (the name does not really matter).
3. On your computer, download this folder and unzip it.
4. Upload all the files and folders from inside the folder to the GitHub repository
   (you can drag-and-drop them in the GitHub web interface).
5. In the repository, go to Settings → Pages.
6. Under "Source", choose "Deploy from a branch".
7. Choose branch `main` (or `master`) and folder `/root` (if GitHub asks).
8. Save. After a few minutes GitHub will give you a public URL such as
   `https://yourusername.github.io/andrea-novellis-site`.

Later, if you buy a custom domain like `andreanovellis.it`, you can point it to this GitHub Pages site
by adding a CNAME in the repository and updating your domain's DNS settings.
